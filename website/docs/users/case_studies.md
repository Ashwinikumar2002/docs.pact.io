## Atlassian: Jira

> A project with a tight deadline (8 weeks), external customers, and a lot of "unknown unknowns", led us to one overarching driver: we needed to move quickly, and iterate on our API fast as we received feedback from our external customers. The team moved to a specification-first approach, meaning APIs were documented, codified in tests and shared with all parties.
