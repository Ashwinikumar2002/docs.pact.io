## Community corner - member shout outs

### Paulo Gon√ßalves

We know it can be difficult to visualise the path to Pact Nirvana, the
recommend CI/CD setup for your Pact integrations. Contributors have been
adding their valuable experiences from lessons learnt in the field.

**[Paulo Gon√ßalves](https://twitter.com/paulorgoncalves)** did just that in this
[repository](https://github.com/PauloGoncalvesBH/contract-test-nirvana).
It exemplifies the best implementations of contract testing, reaching
Pact Nirvana and having control via pipeline and pact-broker in a
completely reliable way. This provides security to deploy quickly,
safely, and more frequently.

*Please give the repository a star* ‚≠ê as this is a great motivator for
*Paulo to continue to create quality software content, which is 100%
free to use!*

PLUS extra kudos to Paulo, who delivered a [contract testing workshop entirely in Portuguese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c2JmM9dafA) for
our Portuguese-speaking friends!

### Eric Deandrea and Holly Cummins

Many thanks to **[Eric Deandrea](https://twitter.com/edeandrea) and [Holly Cummins](https://twitter.com/holly_cummins),** who co-delivered a fantastic, funny talk at Devoxx Belgium on "[How to avoid common pitfalls with modern microservices testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYwkDPrzqV8)". I enjoyed watching this, and think challenging mental models is a wonderful way to break down an often complex and misunderstood subject

Holly has been particularly active whilst she worked in the IBM Garage,
so it's wonderful to see her delivering fantastic talks.

### Liran Tal

A talented Developer Advocate, **[Liran Tal](https://twitter.com/liran_tal)** at Snyk is a long-time
friend of the Pact Open Source Foundation. He often tours the conference
circuit in his easily recognizable green hat.

Liran created the incredible [**Comprehensive Guide to Contract Testing
APIs in a Service Oriented
Architecture**](https://www.lirantal.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-contract-testing-apis-in-a-service-oriented-architecture-5695ccf9ac5a)"**.**
He's also the author of
[awesome-contract-testing](https://github.com/lirantal/awesome-contract-testing)
because, as you already know, contract testing is AWESOME! üëå
And because we love videos, I recommend his talk [Consumer-Driven
Contract: A better approach for API
Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfGKX5iKSis) from APIdays
Barcelona.

*Thank you to all our community members. The effort you put into our
community is appreciated!*

## Become a contributor

As the Pact Community Shepherd, I'm dedicated to making it as easy as
possible to get involved in the Pact Open Source Project.

There's no minimum time commitment, but we highly value regular,
committed contributions, as these make the Pact OSS vibrant and healthy.

Not sure where to start?

With the impending official launch of the **Pact Plugins Framework,**
we're on the lookout for enthusiasts who want to build their own profile
and be a part of the future of Pact. We're looking for individual
people or teams interested in extending Pact by [creating a
plugin](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/pact_plugins/docs/writing-plugin-guide)

- such as Avro or GraphQL content type or a Websockets transport.

If this sounds like something you'd like to know more about, join us
next month at our launch event to learn about the Plugin Framework and how you can get
involved. You can checkout the details and register [üëâ here](/events/plugins-framework-launch)

Whether you've participated before or are ready to take the first
plunge, the team and I are here to support you! Need extra convincing? I
wrote about why participating in OSS projects is awesome, for DevPro
Journal!

You can also read our [Pact Open contributing
page](https://docs.pact.io/contributing) to learn about the different
ways to get involved in Open Source, no matter what role or skillset you
hold.

That's all for now. Catch you on Slack!

    Shepherd at Pact.
